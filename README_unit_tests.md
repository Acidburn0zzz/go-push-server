Instructions for running pushgo unit tests
====

The pushgo unit tests (available under https://github.com/jrconlin/pushgo/mod_tests ) are stand-alone full server tests for SimplePush.

The stand-alone tests currently presume:
1) The server is running on localhost:8080
2) The PUT notification prefix is "/update/"
